# Contributing

There are many ways of contrinuting to this project. One way is by putting up an issue and stating the feature or bug you have found in the project.

To make code contributions follow the guide below.

## Guide line

Fork the repo [here](https://github.com/EteimZ/lingo)

Clone your own forked version locally.

Create a branch on your local repo. The branch name should have the prefix of `feature-`. 
The second part could be anything you choose but it's name should be in line with the feature you are adding.

For example if you are adding a login feature, the branch name should be `feature-login`.

```bash
git branch -m feature-login
```

All of your changes should be made on that branch.

When you feature is ready, make a push to your forked repo on github and make a PR from there to this repo.
